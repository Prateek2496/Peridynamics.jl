## What is peridynamics?
Peridynamics is a non-local formulation of continuum mechanics where material points represent the continuum, and the relative displacements and forces are governed by an integro-differential equation that allows discontinuities. As a result, peridynamics is particularly well-suited for dynamic fracture simulations involving numerous cracks.

## Who can benefit from this package?
This package is designed for anyone interested in performing peridynamics simulations. With its intuitive high-level API and the incredible performance of Julia, users can seamlessly delve into the world of peridynamics. While the current feature set provides a solid foundation, we are continuously working to enhance and expand the capabilities of `Peridynamics.jl`. We encourage you to open an issue or submit a pull request to share your feedback and make this package even more valuable to the community!
