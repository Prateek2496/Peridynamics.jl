    abstract = {Some materials may naturally form discontinuities such as cracks as a result of deformation. As an aid to the modeling of such materials, a new framework for the basic equations of continuum mechanics, called the ‘peridynamic’ formulation, is proposed. The propagation of linear stress waves in the new theory is discussed, and wave dispersion relations are derived. Material stability and its connection with wave propagation is investigated. It is demonstrated by an example that the reformulated approach permits the solution of fracture problems using the same equations either on or off the crack surface or crack tip. This is an advantage for modeling problems in which the location of a crack is not known in advance.}
